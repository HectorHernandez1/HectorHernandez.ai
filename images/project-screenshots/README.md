# Project Screenshots

🌐 Portfolio live at: [https://www.hectorhernandez.dev](https://www.hectorhernandez.dev)

This directory contains screenshots for each of the featured projects on your portfolio.

## Required Images

Add the following images with recommended dimensions of **800x600px** (4:3 aspect ratio):

1. **etl-pipeline.jpg** - High-Performance ETL Pipeline Demo
   - Suggestion: Screenshot of Airflow DAG dashboard or data flow diagram
   - Alternative: Architecture diagram showing data pipeline components

2. **rest-api.jpg** - REST API with Advanced Features
   - Suggestion: Swagger/OpenAPI documentation interface
   - Alternative: Postman collection or API architecture diagram

3. **realtime-dashboard.jpg** - Real-Time Data Processing Dashboard
   - Suggestion: Screenshot of dashboard with live charts/graphs
   - Alternative: System architecture showing WebSocket connections

4. **db-analyzer.jpg** - Database Performance Analyzer
   - Suggestion: Query execution plan visualization
   - Alternative: Performance metrics dashboard

5. **distributed-system.jpg** - Distributed System Implementation
   - Suggestion: System architecture diagram
   - Alternative: Console output showing distributed processing

6. **ml-deployment.jpg** - ML Model Deployment Pipeline
   - Suggestion: MLOps pipeline diagram or model inference interface
   - Alternative: Jupyter notebook with model training/results

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP (WebP preferred for performance)
- **Dimensions**: 800x600px or similar 4:3 ratio
- **File Size**: Optimize to <200KB per image
- **Quality**: High enough to look professional, compressed for web performance

## Temporary Placeholder

The website includes JavaScript that automatically generates gradient placeholder images if the files are missing. This allows you to see the layout while you prepare your actual project screenshots.

## Tools for Creating Images

- **Screenshots**: Use macOS Screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4) or Snipping Tool (Windows)
- **Diagrams**: draw.io (diagrams.net), Lucidchart, or Figma
- **Optimization**: TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or online tools like Squoosh
- **Mockups**: Use browser dev tools to create clean screenshots without personal data

## Example Sources

If you don't have projects built yet:
1. Create architecture diagrams for planned projects
2. Screenshot documentation/README from similar open-source projects (with attribution)
3. Create mockups in Figma or similar tools
4. Use gradient placeholders generated automatically by the site

Once you have your images, simply drop them in this directory with the exact filenames listed above.
